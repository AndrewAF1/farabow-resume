    {\large\textbf{\underline{\smash{Work Experience}}}} \\
    \textbf{Undergraduate Research Assistant - Virginia Tech \hfill 2019 - present}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Working for the Hume Center for National Security and Technology under Prof. Daniel Doyle to create and train convolutional neural networks for drone-mounted object detection and classification
      \item Working for the Center for Bioinspired Science and Technology under Prof. Rolf Mueller to interpret sonar data with deep learning
    \end{itemize}


    \textbf{Machine Learning Engineer Intern - Decipher Technology Studios \hfill 2018 - present}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Working on a small team to develop Sense, a new product which provides deep reinforcement learning-powered predictive autoscaling for Decipherâ€™s Grey Matter service mesh
      \item Studied and implemented policy gradient, Q-Learning, and actor-critic approaches to deep reinforcement learning (DQN, DDPG, A2C, PPO, SAC, etc)
      \item Wrote a microservice environment simulator for offline training with another intern and created a rule-based autoscaler to jumpstart training via imitation learning.
      \item Configured and deployed demos to AWS and Openshift for client meetings and industry conferences.
      \item Added recurrent and convolutional layers to the neural networks to better leverage time-series data
      \item Collected metrics using Prometheus and Gatling and tested various model architectures on the data
      \item Compared the performance of different configurations of Sense and kept detailed records of the results
    \end{itemize}
