    \textbf{Machine Learning Engineer Intern - Decipher Technology Studios \hfill 2018 - present}
    \begin{itemize}
      \itemsep0em
      \item Working on a small team to develop Sense, a new product which provides deep reinforcement learning-powered predictive autoscaling for Decipherâ€™s Grey Matter service mesh
      \item Studied and implemented policy gradient, Q-Learning, and actor-critic approaches to deep reinforcement learning (DQN, DDPG, A2C, PPO, SAC, etc)
      \item Wrote a microservice environment simulator for offline training with another intern and created a rule-based autoscaler to jumpstart training via imitation learning.
      \item Added recurrent and convolutional layers to the neural networks to better leverage time-series data
      \item Collected metrics using Prometheus and Gatling and tested various model architectures on the data
      \item Created infrastructure to deploy Sense as a service on Openshift and Elastic Kubernetes Service.
